My Coding Best Practises 

- Create understandable code that will be easy to interpret by outsiders and by you in 6 months by:
	 
Follow the guidelines from https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Variables:  
- lower case separated with underscores
- Use descriptive names for variables
- Dont use l, O as they can be confused with zeros and ones

Function Naming: 
- lower case separated with underscores
- Add a descriptive comments what does the function do. with """. and ending with """ on its on separate line

Libraries: 
-Import libraries on top of the file / module 

Community conventions:  
- Be careful with linings (1 line vs multiple lines)
- limit line to 70 charactes
- use operators after the line break
- Indent with 4 spaces 

Other (git,..) 
- Keep comments up-to-date and according to the code 
- Classes naming with capital and CamelCase
- Don't change the original files always clone and push the update with a comment what has been edited
