### Reading about Statistics 

#### Challenge 1 - What is the difference between expected value and mean? 

Expected value is an average based on a number of observations and probability that an outcome happens. 
Mean again is the sum of outcomes divided by the count. 

If the number of observations is low, it is likely that there is a difference in the mean and expected value.
However, when the number of observations increases the mean typically becomes similar to the expected value. 

#### Challenge 2 - What is the "problem" in science with p-values? 

P-value is used to determine the statistical significance of a finding. Typically there is a treshold value such as 0.05, that signifies
whether the results are statistically significant or not.

No significance does not necessarily mean there is no effect. It can be misleading to use p-value as categorical attribute. This is mostly
due to the fact that p-value can vary quite significantly between different studies and can vary even in exact replicated studies.

Moreover, often decision making should be based on many different attributes (cost, benefits , likelihood etc) and not just statistical significance. 

With final note, p-values should not be disregarded, but their direct categorical interpretation should be changed.
The p-values still provide important information, but we can report them together with our assumptions to support
the evaluation of hypothesis.
